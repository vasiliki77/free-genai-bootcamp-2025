# Writing Practice of Diacritics

Greek orthography has used a variety of diacritics starting in the Hellenistic period. The more complex polytonic orthography, which includes five diacritics, notates Ancient Greek phonology. The simpler monotonic orthography, introduced in 1982, corresponds to Modern Greek phonology, and requires only two diacritics.

Polytonic orthography includes:

- acute accent (´)
- circumflex accent (ˆ)
- grave accent (`); these 3 accents indicate different kinds of pitch accent
- rough breathing (῾) indicates the presence of the /h/ sound before a letter
- smooth breathing (᾿) indicates the absence of /h/.

In this app we will practice typing the diacritics with a greek polytonic keyboard.

## Installing greek polytonic keyboard

### **Windows**  
Go to **Settings** > **Time & Language** > **Language & region**. Click **Add a language**, search for **Greek**, and install it. Then, click on **Greek**, go to **Keyboard options**, and add **Greek Polytonic**. Switch between keyboards using **Win + Space**.
