Today I created comprehensive technical specification documents for the language learning portal project:
1. Frontend Technical Specs
- Defined 10 main pages including Dashboard, Study Activities, Words, Groups, and Settings
- Detailed the purpose, components, and required API endpoints for each page
- Outlined key features like study progress tracking, activity launching, and word management
2. Backend Technical Specs
- Established core business goals for a language learning portal
- Defined technical stack: Go backend with SQLite3 database using Gin framework
- Designed database schema with 6 main tables:
    - words
    - groups
    - words_groups
    - study_sessions
    - study_activities
    - word_review_items
- Specified 15+ API endpoints to support the frontend functionality

The specifications create a foundation for a single-user learning portal that will serve as both a vocabulary inventory system and a learning record store, while providing a unified launch point for various learning activities.
