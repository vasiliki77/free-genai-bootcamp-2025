## GenAI Architecting

Today, I focused on creating a **conceptual diagram** in Lucidchart following along the GenAI Architecting lecture.  

As a Solution Architect, my goal is to design architectural diagrams that help stakeholders understand the key components of GenAI workloads. 
These diagrams should guide discussions on **infrastructure choices, integration patterns, and system dependencies** without directly prescribing solutions.  

#### Conceptual Diagram  
**Purpose**  
- Provides a **high-level overview** of the business solution.  
- Helps non-technical stakeholders understand the general architecture.  
- Focuses on **what** is being built, not **how** it will be implemented.

Completed a conceptual diagram in Lucidchart based on the instructor's work to illustrate key components of a GenAI workload. I also documented architectural considerations in a README file to align with the business and technical goals.
